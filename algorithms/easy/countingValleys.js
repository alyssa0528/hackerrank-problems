// Gary is an avid hiker. He tracks his hikes meticulously, paying close attention to small details like topography. During his last hike he took exactly n steps. For every step he took, he noted if it was an uphill, U, or a downhill, D step. Gary's hikes start and end at sea level and each step up or down represents a 1 unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:

// A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
// A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.
// Given Gary's sequence of up and down steps during his last hike, find and print the number of valleys he walked through.

// For example, if Gary's path is s = [DDUUUUDD], he first enters a valley 2 units deep. Then he climbs out an up onto a mountain 2 units high. Finally, he returns to sea level and ends his hike.
